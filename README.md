**Usage** <br />
The File Organizer GUI application allows you to easily sort files within a selected directory based on their file extensions. Follow the instructions below to use the GUI effectively. <br />
The script will create folders based on file extensions (e.g., Images, Documents, Music) and move the corresponding files into these folders. <br />


**Example:** <br />
Suppose you have the following files in a directory:  <br />
/Downloads<br />
├── vacation.jpg<br />
├── song.mp3<br />
├── report.pdf<br />
├── script.py<br />

Running the script will organize the files as follows:<br />
/Downloads <br />
├── Images<br />
│   └── vacation.jpg<br />
├── Music<br />
│   └── song.mp3<br />
├── Documents<br />
